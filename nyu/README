Multicore Processors Final Project

The main source code for this project lives on github, as we had to adapt multi2sim which is too large to submit. However, we have included Cache.h and Cache.cc from multi2sim/src/memory with this submission, as they contain the majority of our work. Additional changes were made to multi2sim in order to pass core information to the cache.

Instructions to test the code:

Setup 1:
Clone the repository
	
	git clone https://github.com/robbiefrost/multi2sim

Setup 2:
Build the simulator according to the instructions in the repository's readme. This may take a few minutes.
	
	cd multi2sim && libtoolize && aclocal && autoconf && automake --add-missing && ./configure && make

Testing:
In "multi2sim/nyu" we have scripts for running various splash benchmarks, as well as a very basic test script (test-threads.sh). The scripts use the configurations in "nyu/config" to test different L2 shared cache replacement policies. Using run.sh will run the barnes, fft, radix, and lu-cont benchmarks with predetermined program parameters. Each benchmark will be run in separate processes using screen.
