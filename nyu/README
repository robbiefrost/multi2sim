Multicore Processors Final Project

The multi2sim folder contains the source code for this project, which is also available on github (easier to install from there). The bulk of our work was done in Cache.h and Cache.cc from multi2sim/src/memory, so we have also copied those files to the top level of our submission for easy inspection. Additional changes were made throughout the simulator in order to pass information about the cores to the cache.

Instructions to test the code:

Setup 1:
Clone the repository
	
	git clone https://github.com/robbiefrost/multi2sim

Setup 2:
Build the simulator according to the instructions in the repository's readme. This will take some time (ignore the warnings).
	
	cd multi2sim && libtoolize && aclocal && autoconf && automake --add-missing && ./configure && make

Testing:
In "multi2sim/nyu" we have scripts for running various splash benchmarks, as well as a very basic test script (test-threads.sh). The scripts use the configurations in "nyu/config" to test different L2 shared cache replacement policies. Using run.sh will run the barnes, fft, radix, and lu-cont benchmarks with predetermined program parameters. Each benchmark will be run in separate processes using screen. You may have to do chmod 777 to run the shell scripts.
