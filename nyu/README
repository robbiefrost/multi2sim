This folder is to run simulations of shared cache replacement algorithms on Multi2Sim simulator.


Step 1:

This simulator is intended to run on NYU crunchy cluster. Move file and ssh to crunchy.

Step 2:

To run, first compile this version of Multi2Sim according to instructions from github:

	$> libtoolize
	$> aclocal
	$> autoconf
	$> automake --add-missing
	$> ./configure
	$> make 

Step 3: 

cd to this directory "multi2sim/nyu". Scripts made use relative address.

Step 4:

	The following script runs the barnes, fft, radix, and lu-cont benchmarks with predetermined program parameters. Each benchmark will be run in separate processes using screen. 

	$> ./run.sh


In this testing the LRU, FLRU, and FLURP cache replacement policies are tested for each benchmark.
